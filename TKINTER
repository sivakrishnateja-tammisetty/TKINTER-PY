  *TKINTER: TKINTER helps us to create GUI applications.
  *GUI means graphical user interface.
  *Tkinter is a built-in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The name "Tkinter" is a portmanteau of "Tk" and "interface," where "Tk" refers to the Tk GUI toolkit, which Tkinter is based on.
  *Tkinter provides a set of tools and widgets for creating windows, dialog boxes, buttons, text fields, labels, and other GUI elements that allow users to interact with Python applications in a more visually appealing and user-friendly way.


  *INSTALL:  
            To install the tkinter module in Python, you can typically use the command pip install python-tk or  if it's not already included with your Python distribution.

  STEPS:
  step 1: import tkinter module.
  step 2: GUI interaction.
  step 3: adding inputs
  step 4: main loop


*HELLO WORLD USING TKINTER:
 -------------------------

*In Tkinter, a Label is a widget used to display text or images in a graphical user interface (GUI). 
*Labels are typically used to provide information, captions, or instructions to the user. 

Eg1:
from tkinter import *
window=Tk()                               
INPUT=Label(window,text="Hello World!")
INPUT.pack()
window.mainloop()

Note:
 * window as object name & Tk is class.
 * if we didnt write mainloop(), it will not display ouput and error as well.
